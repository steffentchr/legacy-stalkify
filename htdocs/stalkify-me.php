<h3>How do I get stalked?</h3>
<p>Stalkify works with everything that speak <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a> &minus; so if you want to be stalked, you simply need to set your Winamp, your iTunes, your Spotify or your whatever up to tell Last.fm about the tracks you're playing.</p>


<h3>Spotify Desktop?</h3>
<p>Spotify can be made to lastfmify your tracks under <i>Preferences</i>:</p>
